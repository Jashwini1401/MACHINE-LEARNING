It involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time based on the data they are exposed to.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**2.Task:-** A machine learning task is the specific problem you want the algorithm to solve. Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Classification: Assigning data points to categories (e.g., spam detection).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Regression: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., house price prediction).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.Model:-** A machine learning model is a mathematical representation of the patterns and relationships learned from the data. It is the core component that makes predictions or decisions. Different types of models include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.Loss Function:-** A loss function measures how well the model is performing on the given task. It quantifies the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values in the training data. The goal of training is to minimize this loss function.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5.Learning Algorithm:-** A learning algorithm is a set of rules or procedures used to adjust the model's parameters in order to minimize the loss function. Examples include gradient descent, backpropagation, and genetic algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6.Evaluation:-** After training a model, it's crucial to evaluate its performance on unseen data. This helps to ensure that the model generalizes well and can make accurate predictions on new inputs. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",

        "**3.Convergence and Overfitting:-** Observing the loss value over training iterations helps identify if the model is converging towards a solution. If the loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, it could indicate issues like overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",

        "\n",
